# **Assignment: Dart Programming with Islamic Insights**  

### **Course:** Mobile App Development (Dart & Flutter)  
### **Instructor:** Syed M Arsalan Shah  
### **Due Date:** 03-04-2025   
### **Submission Platform:** GitHub  

---

## **Objective**  
This assignment aims to strengthen your Dart programming skills while integrating meaningful Islamic concepts into coding exercises. You will practice variables, data types, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, and loops.  

---

## **Instructions**  
1. **Clone a GitHub Repository:**  
   - Create a repository on GitHub named `Dart-Assignment-IslamicInsights`.  
   - Clone the repository to your local system.  

2. **Create a Dart Project:**  
   - Inside the repository, create a Dart project with separate `.dart` files for each task.  
   - Follow the file naming conventions similar to the lecture files shown in the provided image.  

---

## **Tasks**  

### **1. Variables and Data Types (Lecture01Variables and Data Types)**
   - Create a Dart program that declares and initializes variables for the **Five Pillars of Islam** (e.g., `String shahadah = "There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His Messenger.";`).
   - Print each variable using `print()`.  

### **2. Arithmetic Operators (Lecture02Arithmetic Operators)**
   - Write a Dart program that calculates **Zakat** based on a given wealth amount (e.g., `nisab` and `2.5%` of total wealth).
   - Implement calculations for **Sadaqah** and **fasting compensations (fidya/kafarah)** using arithmetic operations.  

### **3. Conditional Statements - If/Else (Lecture03ConditionalStatement_IfElse)**
   - Create a Dart program that asks the user for their **daily Salah count** (input as an integer).  
   - Use `if-else` conditions to print messages of encouragement if they performed all **five prayers** or a reminder to complete missed prayers.  

### **4. Conditional Statements - Switch Case (Lecture04ConditionalStatement_switchcase)**
   - Implement a switch-case program that asks the user to enter a day of the week and returns a special Islamic recommendation for that day (e.g., **Friday**: "Read Surah Al-Kahf, attend Jumu'ah prayer").  

### **5. Loops - For, While (Lecture05Loops & Lecture06WhileLoop)**
   - **For Loop:** Print the **99 names of Allah (Asma ul Husna)** using a `for` loop.  
   - **While Loop:** Create a program that continuously asks the user to enter Quranic verses they've memorized until they type `"exit"`.  

---

## **Bonus Task (Optional)**
- Create a simple Dart-based **Qibla direction calculator** (based on user-provided latitude and longitude).  

---

## **Submission Guidelines**
1. **Push your code to GitHub:**  
   - Add all Dart files to your GitHub repository.  
   - Write a `README.md` file explaining your project and its Islamic significance.  
   - Include comments in the code referencing Quranic verses or Hadith where applicable.  

2. **GitHub Submission Format:**  
   - Repository Name: `Dart-Assignment-IslamicInsights`  
   - Directory Structure:  
     ```
     Dart-Assignment-IslamicInsights/
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Lecture01Variables.dart
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Lecture02Arithmetic.dart

     ```

3. **Submission Confirmation:**  
   - Share your GitHub repository link via email or on the designated LMS platform.
